# Weather Forecast
## Summary
This project seeks to use the Chi-Square test to determine if a weather company's forecast is accurate or inaccurate. The accepted hypothesis is highlighted in yellow. 

### The Chi-Square Value
This number on the sheet is obtained using the chi-square formula. The formula is ((O-E)^2)/E for each data point in the table and then summed. 

### Degrees of Freedom
This number is obtained by taking the number of table columns and subtracting 1 (7 days -1 = 6)

### Alpha Level
This is standard at .05

### Critical Value
This is obtained using an online table

### Conditional Formatting 
The Null and Alternate Hypothesis cells contain a highlight rule. If the Chi-Square value is less than the critical value, the null hypothesis is accepted, otherwise the alternate hypothesis is accepted. (This can be tested by changing numbers in the table to see how the cascading rules and formulas change which cell is highlighted)
